# Pixie-Dust - 2D Lighting System
Template version
 - Original deadline version

Controls - 

    Move the mouse to move the light
    
    '9' & '0' keys to change the light's strength (- & +)

    '1' & '2' keys to change the Graphics Scale (- & +), in quarter scale per press. Looks best when it is set for 16:9.
    
    'Up Arrow' & 'Down Arrow' to change the lightmap resolution value.
    
    Values might need fiddling for specific resolutions, but will generally work for any multiple of 1080p.
    
   
Version -

    The project was created in my freetime during University, and was left unifinished and unorganized, as it was a learning experience.
    
    
Settings -

    The lightmap was initialized for a system of 16:9/1080p resolution, so the Graphics Scale to Resolution ratio may vary by system.
    
    For a short list of known working values, refer to below:
    
        1080p : Default should be working (multiple of 2s)
        1440p : 22 Resolution - 2.75 GS
        4K    : Any Multiple of 1080p Settings have been known to work
